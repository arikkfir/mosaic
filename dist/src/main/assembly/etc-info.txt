Place your system and application configuration files in this directory for auto-deployment.
Configuration files are property files and each file represents a specific configuration (the
configuration name is the file name excluding the extension).

Configuration files are monitored and installed when added, updated when modified, and uninstalled when deleted.

Configurations are consumed in your bundles using the @Configuration method annotation.

You can delete this file if you wish.
