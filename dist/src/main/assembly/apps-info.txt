Place your application descriptor files in this directory for auto-deployment. Application
descriptor files are XML files, and configure your actual applications. Each file represents
an application, whose name is the actual application name (excluding the extension) and
contains application configuration and parameters. Application descriptors in this directory
are monitored and installed when added, updated when modified, and uninstalled when deleted.

You can delete this file if you wish.
