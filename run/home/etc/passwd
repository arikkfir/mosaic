#
# This file should contain user->password mappings for users that are allowed to connect (via SSH)
# to this Mosaic server. The format of the file is the same as a standard Java properties file:
#
# key=value
#
# Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and are ignored.
#
# The passwords here must be encoded as MD5 (the server assumes that). Therefor, passwords sent from
# an SSH client will also be encoded as MD5 and only then compared to the passwords stored in this file.
