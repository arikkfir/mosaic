        <h2>About Mosaic Accounting</h2>
        <p>
            Mosaic Accounting was born out of my need of a simple accounting application. I tried several applications,
            none of which suited my needs and wants. In parallel to this frustration, I was also developing my custom
            <a href="https://github.com/arikkfir/mosaic">web platform</a>, Mosaic Server, and creating an accounting
            application seemed like an excellent chance to both test my server and satisfy my long desire of a decent
            yet simple accounting application.

            The result is what you're reading now.
